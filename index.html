     Our banana smoothie is extra creamy and fruity. Depending on how ripe or sweet your banana and orange are, you may need to add a little extra honey, so add based on your taste. There are many additions you can make.
     For a green smoothie, add 1/2 cup to 1 cup of fresh greens like spinach or kale.
     You can also add more fruit.
 </p>
 
 Add 1/2 cup of strawberries, mango, frozen berries, pineapple, or other favorite fruit.

 </ul>

 Adam and Joanne's Tips How to Freeze or Make Ahead: This recipe makes one smoothie or two kid-size smoothies. 
 Enjoy now, or save for later. To save the smoothie for later, pour each serving into a food-safe resealable plastic bag or container and freeze. Then, about an hour before needing the smoothie, take it out from the freezer. 
 Non-Dairy alternatives: If you are looking for a banana smoothie without yogurt, then simply leave the yogurt out of the recipe above and replace it with more banana, a tablespoon or so of nut butter, mango, or a tablespoon of hemp seeds (great protein source). You may need to add additional water or non-dairy milk to thin the smoothie out a little.
